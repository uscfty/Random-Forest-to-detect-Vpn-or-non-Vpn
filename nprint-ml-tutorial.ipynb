    "Hopefully this gives you a better idea of how nPrint can be used to rapidly train and test models for different traffic analysis problems. While this problem was contrived and simple, the same basic steps can be performed for any single-packet classification problem. If you want to train and test using **sets** of packets as input to a model, you'll either need a model that can handle that input, such as a CNN, or to flatten the 2D packet sample into a 1d sample for use with a model such as the random forest above."
